# Frontend

The Pictshare Book frontend is written in the Next.js framework, with pixi.js for rendering the canvas.

## Stack

The frontend is built using the following technologies:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) as the web framework
- [Pixi.js](https://pixijs.com/) for rendering the canvas
- [Shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for UI components
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling
- [Hookform](https://react-hook-form.com/) for form validation and management
- [Vitepress](https://vitepress.dev/) for documentation

## Overview

The frontend is built on Next.js, because it is a popular and stable framework that is widely used in the industry. It allows for server-side rendering, which improves the initial load time.

The canvas is rendered using Pixi.js, which is an incredibly optimized open-source library for creating interactive 2D content.
Pixi.js is very powerful but also very bare-bones, so most of the functionality needed to be implemented from scratch.

Tailwind in combination with Shadcn/ui provides a fast and flexible way to style the frontend. It allows for rapid prototyping and easy customization while not compromising on the looks.

Clicking the image upload button will open a file picker dialog, allowing you to select an image from your device.
The image will be added to the drawer. You can also pin the drawer to make it easier to add images to the canvas while you're planning your layout.

![Image Upload 2](/assets/image-upload-2.png)

Clicking an image in the drawer will add it to the canvas and select it. The image drawer will show everyones images by default, but you can select the My Images tab to only see the images you uploaded.


#### Text

### Canvas Functions

#### Multiplayer Functionality

![Share Button](/assets/share-button.png)

You can invite friends to join your canvas by clicking the `Share` button in the top right corner.

Clicking the share button will open a dialog where you can enter your friend's email address, set a role and invite them to your canvas.
You can share a link to the canvas with them by clicking the Copy Link button. This will copy the link to your clipboard.

There are currently two roles available: Viewer and Editor.
- Viewer: Can only view the canvas. (Currently anyone can view any canvas if they have the link, so this role doesn't do anything at the moment)
- Editor: Can view and edit the canvas.

> [!NOTE]
> Viewers can currently still move elements on the canvas, but the changes will not be saved and won't be reflected on other users' canvases.

You can remove users from your canvas by clicking the trash icon next to their email in the table below.

![Multiplayer Cursors](/assets/multiplayer-cursors.png)

When a friend joins your canvas, they will appear as a cursor on the canvas. You can see their name next to their cursor. Anything they do will be reflected in real-time on your canvas.
To edit a friend's role you will need to remove them and re-add them with the desired role.

#### Resizing

![Resizing](/assets/resizing.png)

You can select any element on the canvas by clicking on it. When an element is selected, a blue outline and resize handles will appear around the element.
Using these handles, you can resize the element by dragging them.

There are a few ways to resize an element depending on the element type:

##### Most Elements

- Dragging the resize handles will resize the element freely.
- Holding the `Shift` key while dragging the resize handles will resize the element without changing its aspect ratio.
- Holding the `Alt` key while dragging the resize handles will resize the element from the center.

##### Text and Image Elements

- Dragging the resize handles will resize the element while keeping its aspect ratio.
- Holding the `Ctrl` key while dragging the resize handles will resize the element without changing its aspect ratio.
- Holding the `Alt` key while dragging the resize handles will resize the element from the center.

#### Deleting

You can delete any element on the canvas by pressing backspace on your keyboard.
